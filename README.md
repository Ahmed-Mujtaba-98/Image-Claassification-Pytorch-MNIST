# üèùÔ∏è IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING PYTORCH üî•Ô∏è - MNIST DATASET

**About MNIST**

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of a digit between 0 and 9 1. The MNIST database is widely used in machine learning research for benchmarking algorithms.

**About Fashion MNIST**

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. These classes represent different articles of clothing, including T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

    ]

## üå¥Ô∏è Model Training
To starting training the models, run the below command,

```
python train.py --epochs 10 --dataset mnist --model Net
```

To save best model during training, run the below command,

```
python train.py --epochs 10 --dataset mnist --model Net --save_model
```

To resume training from saved checkpoint, run the below command,

```
python train.py --epochs 10 --dataset mnist --model Net --resume
```
